# Attention
This Repository is not being worked on. No Issues will be fixed. No Pull/Merge requests will be processed.
I will start a similar project later with C++, Gtk and WebKitGtk.
# Bird Browser
The Bird Browser is a browser written in Python and Qt.
The browser.ui file can be loaded in the qt-designer.
This is how I want the browser to look at some point.
Planed features are:
- [x] tabs
- [x] search engine integration
- [x] source-code view
- [x] password manager integration
- [x] bookmarks
- [x] configuration
- [ ] extensions

Some of these features weren't done by me before.
This Project also has an Adblocker build into it.
## Installation
Finished versions can be found on pip: `pip install bird-browser`
earlier versions can be installed like this: `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bird-browser`.
Maybe you need to install the birdlib separatly: `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ birdlib`.
To run an installation via pip use: `python -m bird-browser`. See the wiki for more information.
## Wiki
The wiki/manual/cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/ULUdev/bird-browser/wiki).
