<h1>Bird Browser</h1>
<p>The Bird browser is a browser written in Python and Qt</p>
<p>the browser.ui file can be loaded in the qt-designer.</p>
<p> This is how I want the browser to look at some point</p>
<p>planed features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabs</li>
<li>search engine integration</li>
<li>source-code view</li>
<li>password manager integration</li>
<li>bookmarks</li>
<li>configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>some of these features weren't done by me before</p>
<p>This Project also has an Adblocker build into it. This adblocker uses the easylist.txt file to filter requests</p>
<p>to manually update <b>only</b> the easylist file use:</p>
<code>curl https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt > easylist.txt</code>
<p>make shure that you are in the right directory (birdlib)</p>
