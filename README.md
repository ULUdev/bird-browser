# Bird Browser
The Bird Browser is a browser written in Python and Qt.
The browser.ui file can be loaded in the qt-designer.
This is how I want the browser to look at some point.
Planed features are:
- [x] tabs
- [x] search engine integration
- [x] source-code view
- [ ] password manager integration
- [x] bookmarks
- [x] configuration
- [ ] extensions

Some of these features weren't done by me before.
This Project also has an Adblocker build into it.
