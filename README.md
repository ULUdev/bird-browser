# Bird Browser
The Bird browser is a browser written in Python and Qt
the browser.ui file can be loaded in the qt-designer.
 This is how I want the browser to look at some point
planed features are:
- Tabs
- search engine integration
- source-code view
- password manager integration
- bookmarks
- configuration
- extensions
some of these features weren't done by me before
This Project also has an Adblocker build into it.
